# Canada can't become America

Canada has always had to be a cautious neighbour of America. We have watched it
go through revolutions of epic proportions and build itself up on the back of
slavery. It has created and spearheaded the most important innovations in the
history of humanity. It is the driving force behind the modern world. It created
freedom. America has always been about doing good, but there is a raw force to
it that always has casualties. The further we go back in time the more you will
find Canadian leaders on all sides waning in caution to ensure that America lets
us be. This is the reason that we come across as very polite.

We are stoic people who understand the meaning of common good. This
understanding has been quintessential in the preservation of our society and
the basis of our values. We can not forget the true reason that so many of us
have died for this nation. We have no ego, because having one would put us in
danger of loosing what we have worked so hard to create.

The political system in America is designed to let freedom reign, and is
naturally polarizing. It encourages an us versus them view of the world. The
reality is that there can only be one America and everyone else just has to
learn how to deal with it. Canada has always managed to be the good neighbour
and do what it can to help out. This has always been in a process to ensure our
unity. From far and wide.

# Unity before politics

In Canada we have many parties because it ensures that more points of view are
represented. In America they have as few parties as possible so that the most
amount of power can be attained. America believes that power is needed to get
things done, and it works for them. It's just two people facing off, with one
argument against the other. The better man wins and the adgenda is carried
out in its raw and pure vision. If you are the world super power, you get to
opperate this way. In America powerful people desire to be mayors and political
allegiance is paramount.

In Canada the mayor is one vote that is mean as a symbol of the common voice.
Our mayors are meant to have no political allegiance. Their role is to persaude
counsil to think about the common voice before that of their own wards. City
hall is resonsible for the aspects of our lives that effect us each and every
day. There is no value in letting politics slow that process down.

# The Conservative movement is hurting Canada

For the first 70 years of Canada the Liberal party helped shape our identity.
The center-left party was Canada's first and the point of view was a truly
Canadian one. As Western Canada developed so did its point of view and the
center-right Progressive Conservatives were started to better represent. As
time went on the Tories weakened and the Liberals became entrenched in cronyism.
The New Democrats were kicked off to ensure that society kept up with modern
values and universal health care was born.

With the onset of median Canada began to become more aquainted with American
culture. Through this process Canadians have become inundated with the idea that
certain groups may be out to get each other. In the ninties The Bloc Québécois
came into power in an effort to separate from Canada. The Western Reform Party
proppped up a few years later with much of the same intent. In the end the
referendum of Quebec only made Canada stronger.

Steven Harper is a brilliant politcal mind and managed to learn from all of
this. If Canada could have a Conservative Party that mirrored that of the
American GOP it could ride on any rhetoric that suited it. American media
is designed to sell ideas and points of view to people. Ten years ago
the Candian Alliance was created in a merger of the Reform and Progressive
Conservatives. Ever since then it has been a war between liberal and
conservative ideals. This process is destroying Canadian values and we have
become irrational in our opposition to each other.

# Amalgamation destroyed the spirit of Toronto

Once upon a time people of Etobikoke told the GTA that they were from Etobikoke
and the rest of world that they were from Toronto. Guess what, they still do.
No one in Toronto wanted amalgamation. The conservative party had the authority
to hand the raw deal and they took no prisoners in getting it carried out. They
got to look like heros to conservative Ontario for saving a few bucks while
Toronto got to start hating itself. Mission accomplished and now it is too
expensive to reverse the process.

Today Toronto has become a polarized voting base and it is open season for
federal politicians to interfere. In the end Torontonians are left with rhetoric
and no real action.

# Rob Ford is not a Conservative

Rob Ford is a personality and a real voice of the people, he could have been a
very good mayor of Etobikoke. All a mayor needs to be is likeable and represent
something that everyone can relate to. The reality is that the urban core of
Toronto has a lot of elitsm and apathy. It is just how big cities are, people
tend to have a mission beyond the home. Suburban folks have a strong sense of
community and value their personal property. The difference in these points of
view will always clash when stacked against each other. It becomes us vs them.

Rob Ford will always drive out more voters because he has become a symbol of
suburban values. These are not Conservative values, and by now the federal
Conservative party likely wishes they had not created this association. Rob
Ford grew up in the city burbs, and drugs are just a part of that culture. It
is not evil, it is just reality. The suburban voters of Toronto understand this
and will always back him. Even though they are the suburbs,it is still city
life. It tends to be a little rough, but the people are good and passionate.
