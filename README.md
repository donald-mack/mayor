# Canada can't become America

Canada has always had to be a cautious neighbour of America. We have watched it
go through revolutions of epic proportions and build itself up on the back of
slavery. It has created and spearheaded the most important innovations in the
history of humanity. It is the driving force behind the modern world. It created
freedom. America has always been about doing good, but there is a raw force to
it that always has casualties. The further we go back in time the more you will
find Canadian leaders on all sides waning in caution to ensure that America lets
us be. This is the reason that we come across as very polite.

We are stoic people who understand the meaning of common good. This
understanding has been quintessential in the preservation of our society and
the basis of our values. We can not forget the true reason that so many of us
have died for this nation. We have no ego, because having one would put us in
danger of loosing what we have worked so hard to create.

The political system in America is designed to let freedom reign, and is
naturally polarizing. It encourages an us versus them view of the world. The
reality is that there can only be one America and everyone else just has to
learn how to deal with it. Canada has always managed to be the good neighbour
and do what it can to help out. This has always been in a process to ensure our
unity. From far and wide.

# Unity before politics
