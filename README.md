mayor
=====

A project dedicated to replacing Canadian mayors with democratic Open Source platforms.  City council is no place for politics, especially in polarizing situations like the city of Toronto. Every redsident should have access to a real time say in what goes on in their city and what it's top priorities ought to be.
